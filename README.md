# PhotosPickerDemo

This demonstrates using the SwiftUI `PhotosPicker` view
that was added in iOS 16.
It is based on the YouTube video by Stewart Lynch at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfUBKhZLcK0.

When testing in Preview or Simulator,
don't select the image containing red flowers.
There is an issue with that image that prevents loading it.
